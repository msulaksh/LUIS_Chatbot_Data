# LUIS_Chatbot_Data
As I am working with Microsoft LUIS and Bot Framework, here`s little data for any one interested in LUIS.

I am adding the list of Intents I have created and used for my LUIS App.
I am also adding common Entities.

Add intents and entities to your LUIS app and then code responses for particular intent.
